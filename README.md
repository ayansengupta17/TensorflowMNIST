This repo is just meant for practicing small neural network models with tensorflow on mnist datasets.  

## mnsit_tf.py
This is just a simple neural network model with 4 hidden layers. One can easily change the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons. I have experimented with a lot of hyper parameters. I will list the best two results I got from this model. Truly speaking this is a lame model by todays standards, nevertheless a good point to start.

* optimizer: Adam Optimizer with default learning rate.
